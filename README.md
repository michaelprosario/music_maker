I do want to give a shout out to David Ingram of Google for putting together jsmidgen. Davidâ€™s library handled all the low-level concerns for generating MIDI files, adding tracks, and notes. Please keep in mind that MIDI is a music protocol and file format that focuses on the idea of turning notes and off like switches over time. Make sure to check out his work here:
